## Fabric 

If the Fabric team happens to stumble upon this message, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for dedicating your valuable time to read it. Furthermore, I would like to propose an idea: the addition of a Scala API for Fabric would be truly remarkable. By embracing this opportunity, a whole new realm of modding could be unlocked, enabling individuals to create mods using the powerful Scala programming language.
